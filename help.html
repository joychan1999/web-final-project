                            in sugar as gulkand.<br>
                            <b>2. Rosa 'Mister Lincoln'</b>
                            <br> also known as 'Mr. Lincoln ', is a dark red Hybrid tea rose cultivar. Bred by Herbert Swim and Weeks Rose Growers in 1964, the rose was named an All-America Rose Selections winner in 1965. 'Mister Lincoln ' is a vigorous,
                            tall upright shrub, 4 to 7 ft (121–213 cm) in height. Blooms are very large, 6 in (15 cm) or more in diameter, with 30 to 35 petals. The rose has a strong damask fragrance. The high-centered, deep red petals are generally borne
                            singly on long stems and do not fade, even in the hottest climates. The shrub is a repeat bloomer. The buds are deep red and open up into large, velvety red, double blossoms. The foliage is dark red when young and becomes leathery
                            and dark, matte green when the plant is older. It is generally healthy and heat tolerant, but is susceptible to blackspot. 'Mister Lincoln ' is hardy to zone 5–9. <br>

                            </b><br> It is a deciduous shrub normally ranging in height from 1–5 metres (3.3–16.4 ft), though sometimes it can scramble higher into the crowns of taller trees. Its stems are covered with small,
                            sharp, hooked prickles, which aid it in climbing. The leaves are pinnate, with 5–7 leaflets. The flowers are usually pale pink, but can vary between a deep pink and white. They are 4–6 centimetres (1.6–2.4 in) in diameter with
                            five petals, and mature into an oval, 1.5–2-centimetre (0.59–0.79 in), red-orange fruit, or hip. <br>

                            and rain tolerant, and very disease resistant, but needs a good nutrient supply and enough sun. In half shade the cultivar is less floriferous. It can be grown as solitary shrub or in groups, in containers or as standard rose
                            to 90 cm (3 ft) high, and is very well suited for cut flowers. Due to its bowing flower heads, training the rose as a small climber along a fence or other supports is recommended.<br>
